>Landon Getz is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Dalhousie University. Landon has a Bachelor of Science Honours degree as well as a certificate in Genetics from Dalhousie University. He is a Vanier Scholar, Killam Laureate, and a member of the Chief Science Advisor's inaugural youth council.
>
>Landon has a keen interest in understanding the genetic mechanisms of bacterial environmental survival and the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis in environmental organisms. Through this interest, Landon has explored the pathogenecity and environmental survival of *Vibrio parahaemolyticus* and the genetics of Type III Secretion System biogenesis in both *V. parahaemolyticus* and Enteropathogenic *E. coli*. Landon is also deeply interested in the intersections between science and society, and uses this interest to pursue the ethical and policy implications of new and emerging medical and genetic technologies, such as CRISPR/Cas. Consequently, Landon has published several peer-reviewed journal articles and commentaries on both microbial genetics and pathogenesis, as well as in bioethics.

# Teaching and Course-Design Experience

## Teaching Philosophy

>>>*“The ultimate goal of farming is not the growing of crops, but the cultivation and perfection of human beings.”*

>>>>**- Masanobu Fukuoka, Farmer and Philosopher**

>As an educator, I consider teaching to be like farming. As settlers, both sides of my family have farmed land in Canada they moved onto as part of the colonization of The West. Reflecting on this profession and on my family’s experiences has given me significant guidance in my teaching career thus far. In line with how Mr. Fukuoka understands the goals of farming, I believe that education’s ultimate goal is the cultivation and perfection of human beings.
>With that in mind, my teaching philosophy broadly covers three areas:

>> **Nuturing Students to grow,** $\\$
>> **Fostering Diversity and Inclusivity,** and $\\$
>> **Building Social Good through Education** $\\$

>For a complete teaching philosophy, please visit: [http://landongetz.com](http://landongetz.com) $\\$
