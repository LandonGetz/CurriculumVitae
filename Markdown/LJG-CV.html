<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Landon J. Getz (PhD) is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Maxwell Lab
at the University of Toronto’s Department of Biochemistry. Dr. Getz
obtained his Ph.D. in Microbiology and Immunoloty at Dalhousie
University in the lab of Dr. Nikhil Thomas, studying <em>Vibrio</em>
genetics and host-pathogen interactions. Landon completed his B.Sc
honours degree, as well as a certificate in Genetics, in 2017, also from
Dalhousie University. Dr. Getz is a Vanier Scholar (2019), Killam
Laureate (2019), and a member of the Chief Science Advisor’s inaugural
youth council (2020).</p>
<p>Dr. Getz has a keen interest in understanding the genetic mechanisms
of bacterial-environmental survival and the genetic and molecular
mechanisms of pathogenesis and phage-predation in <em>Vibrio</em>
species. Dr. Getz has explored the pathogenecity and environmental
survival of <em>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</em> and the genetics of Type
III Secretion System biogenesis in both <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> and
Enteropathogenic <em>E. coli</em>. Dr. Getz is also deeply interested in
the intersections between science and society, and uses this interest to
pursue the ethical and policy implications of new and emerging medical
and genetic technologies, such as CRISPR/Cas. Consequently, Dr. Getz has
published several peer-reviewed journal articles and commentaries on
both microbial genetics and pathogenesis, as well as in bioethics.</p>

<p>As an educator, I consider teaching to be like farming. As settlers,
both sides of my family have farmed land in Canada they moved onto as
part of the colonization of The West. Reflecting on this profession and
on my family’s experiences has given me significant guidance in my
teaching career thus far. In line with how Mr. Fukuoka understands the
goals of farming, I believe that education’s ultimate goal is the
cultivation and perfection of human beings. With that in mind, my
teaching philosophy broadly covers three areas:</p>
